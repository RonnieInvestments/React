            MMuammar Gaddafi (1942–2011) rose to prominence in 1969 when he led a group of young Libyan military officers 
            in a bloodless coup that overthrew King Idris I. At just 27 years old, Gaddafi abolished the monarchy and declared Libya a republic, 
            positioning himself as a revolutionary leader inspired by Arab nationalism, anti-imperialism, and socialism. 
            His rise occurred in a broader regional context marked by decolonization, Cold War rivalries, 
            and the influence of leaders such as Egypt’s Gamal Abdel Nasser.

            During the 1970s, Gaddafi reshaped Libya’s political and economic system. He nationalized oil resources, 
            using state revenues to fund expansive social programs, infrastructure projects, and public services. 
            He introduced a unique political framework known as the Jamahiriya (“state of the masses”), 
            which rejected parliamentary democracy in favor of direct popular governance through local committees. 
            These ideas were formalized in The Green Book, where Gaddafi outlined his alternative to capitalism and communism. 
            In practice, however, decision-making power remained concentrated around him and his inner circle

            Internationally, Gaddafi pursued an assertive and often confrontational foreign policy. 
            He supported anti-colonial movements and revolutionary groups across Africa, the Middle East, and beyond, 
            which brought Libya into conflict with Western powers during the 1970s and 1980s. 
            Accusations of involvement in international terrorism—most notably the 1988 Lockerbie bombing—led 
            to years of sanctions and diplomatic isolation. 
            In the early 2000s, Gaddafi shifted course,restoring relations with Western governments, 
            abandoning weapons programs, and reintegrating Libya into the global system.

            Gaddafi’s rule came to an end in 2011 amid the Arab Spring uprisings. 
            Protests against his government escalated into an armed conflict, prompting NATO military intervention. 
            Gaddafi was captured and killed in October 2011 near his hometown of Sirte. 
            Since his death, Libya has experienced prolonged instability, with competing governments and 
            armed factions struggling for control—highlighting the lasting impact of his four-decade rule on the country’s political structure.
