            The son of an itinerant Bedouin farmer, Qaddafi was born in a tent in the Libyan desert. 
            He proved a talented student and graduated from the University of Libya in 1963. 
            A devout Muslim and ardent Arab nationalist, Qaddafi early began plotting to overthrow the Libyan monarchy of King Idris I. 
            He graduated from the Libyan military academy in 1965 and thereafter rose steadily through the ranks, 
            all the while continuing to plan a coup with the help of his fellow army officers. 
            On September 1, 1969, Qaddafi seized control of the government in a military coup that deposed King Idris. 
            Qaddafi was named commander in chief of the armed forces and chairman of Libya’s new governing body, the Revolutionary Command Council.
